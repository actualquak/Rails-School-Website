# Q/A
## What's this?
This is a rewrite of our school project from the ground up to use bootstrap and ruby on rails.

## Why did you rewrite our school website?
Because it is less effort for a superior result

## How can I view this website?
Download this repo, cd into FRANKLIN/website-snapshot and run `python -m http.server` then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or whatever your url is) and it should show a demo.

## But where did my css go?
In no particular order:
 * The information page was unwieldy and not designed well for ruby
 * The landing page was preventing people from getting to the content of our webpage immediately, however this could be brought back
 * The navbar was unwieldy from a backend perspective, and not suited to navigating between multiple urls (something we are now doing)
 * The navbar also took up too much room, especially on mobile
 * The animations for switching pages do not support multiple urls (once again, something we are now doing)
 * Keeping the css would, to be honest, require more work than redoing from scratch with bootstrap for a superior result

## The navbar looks ugly.
Yes, but
 * It supports mobile
 * It is easily expandable
 * I can add a theme to make it better easily

## Why are there more pages on the navbar?
 * Home is the home page (`/`)
 * Logout is for the user account system I set up (`/logout`)
 * Tour is for the School View ('/tour')
 * Map is for the School Map linking to the School View (`/map`)
 * Articles is to access the articles (`/articles/[article number]`, `/articles`)
 * Forum is for the forum I want to add (`/forum`)
THIS ALL WORKS ON MOBILE (EXCEPT PANNELLUM)

## Accounts? Forums? Comments?
These have three purposes:
 * To flex our database to earn more marks
 * To become a social media service, as every website must eventually become
 * To collect emails

## Bootstrap?
It's a css library, like material, except more popular.

## What can I do on the project?
 * Continue updating streetview.js.
 * Make the map feature.
 * Follow the guide below on how to write articles.

### How to write articles
1. Follow the *How can I view this website* above.
2. There should be two `div`s - one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE TITLE HERE!` inside and one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE CONTENT HERE!`.
3. Put the title inside the first div, and the content inside the second. IMPORTANT - DON'T EDIT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THOSE DIVS!
4. Send me the html that you put inside, as well as the title

## If you need anything else, send me an email. I'll check my email. Probably.

# Q/A - For Stanley
## What's this?
I know what this is idiot and I hate it. What is this Q/A for? To explain why I am angry. Because I am fuming, I will present this as a stuctured case - debating vibes.

## Points
### 1. This will take too much time and effort
### 2. This won't bring much more than we already have
### 3. You're making approx 5000 min (Class time + homework time + robot club) of past work amount to nothing. 

## Rebuttal - My response to your points
### Why did you rewrite our school website?
Because it is less effort for a superior result
**Reply:** Baseless for starters, no reasoning. Superior result? Looks bad. Less effort? Bit late now + having to do major revamping of info page + back-end monstrosity of accounts and forum and comments + rewriting most of the website

### But where did my css go?
In no particular order:
 * The information page was unwieldy and not designed well for ruby
 * The landing page was preventing people from getting to the content of our webpage immediately, however this could be brought back
 * The navbar was unwieldy from a backend perspective, and not suited to navigating between multiple urls (something we are now doing)
 * The navbar also took up too much room, especially on mobile
 * The animations for switching pages do not support multiple urls (once again, something we are now doing)
 * Keeping the css would, to be honest, require more work than redoing from scratch with bootstrap for a superior result
**Reply:** In no particular order:
* Sure, but this means we are deleting a term's work + priortising a framework that Mr. Harrison will give up downloading + have to create an entirely new info page (will take more than time that we have)
* Look, I thought you wanted the starting page
* Sure, was unwieldy, but I quote you saying that mobile support dosen't matter + again quote you saying we don't really care about url access + will take work cssing it back up
* Sure, see last point
* Yes, see 2 points ago, also we could fix that easily, read JS, and you will understand, just have to update move() function
* Sure, bootstrap is cool but it is too late to change

### The navbar looks ugly.
Yes, but
 * It supports mobile
 * It is easily expandable
 * I can add a theme to make it better easily
**Reply:** Yes, but
* So what
* So what
* No. we have too much to do, and will also lose points on looks


### Why are there more pages on the navbar?
 * Home is the home page (`/`)
 * Logout is for the user account system I set up (`/logout`)
 * Tour is for the School View ('/tour')
 * Map is for the School Map linking to the School View (`/map`)
 * Articles is to access the articles (`/articles/[article number]`, `/articles`)
 * Forum is for the forum I want to add (`/forum`)
THIS ALL WORKS ON MOBILE (EXCEPT PANNELLUM)
**Reply:** We don't need this, as I will show in my next rebuttal point. We also shouldn't care about mobile as I have shown earlier.


### Accounts? Forums? Comments?
These have three purposes:
 * To flex our database to earn more marks
 * To become a social media service, as every website must eventually become
 * To collect emails
**Reply:** This will take way too much time that we don't have and:
* All we're doing is removing website marks for looks and adding them for backend. We can also use a db anyway without all theis massive change
* Social media is inethical, and we don't need it, you have said this before making you a hypocrite that has worse values than Mark Zuckerburg and Tim Cook combined. Sorry, but it seems so: at least they weren't hypocrites.
* Just no.

### Bootstrap?
It's a css library, like material, except more popular.
**Reply:** I know what it is, and its not worth it: it would be **IF WE HAD TIME**

### What can I do on the project?
 * Continue updating streetview.js.
 * Make the map feature.
 * Follow the guide below on how to write articles.
**Reply:** I don't really want to work on this project anymore.

### How to write articles
1. Follow the *How can I view this website* above.
2. There should be two `div`s - one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE TITLE HERE!` inside and one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE CONTENT HERE!`.
3. Put the title inside the first div, and the content inside the second. IMPORTANT - DON'T EDIT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THOSE DIVS!
4. Send me the html that you put inside, as well as the title
**Reply:** See last reply.

## Conclusion
I am going to make my repository what I am developing on, not this. The only condition that would break this is if we were to come to agree on a common ground. This is unlikekly, and I would like to see what happens with you on your own. Bye.

# Q/A
## What's this?
This is a rewrite of our school project from the ground up to use bootstrap and ruby on rails.

## Why did you rewrite our school website?
Because it is less effort for a superior result

## How can I view this website?
Download this repo, cd into FRANKLIN/website-snapshot and run `python -m http.server` then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or whatever your url is) and it should show a demo.

## But where did my css go?
In no particular order:
 * The information page was unwieldy and not designed well for ruby
 * The landing page was preventing people from getting to the content of our webpage immediately, however this could be brought back
 * The navbar was unwieldy from a backend perspective, and not suited to navigating between multiple urls (something we are now doing)
 * The navbar also took up too much room, especially on mobile
 * The animations for switching pages do not support multiple urls (once again, something we are now doing)
 * Keeping the css would, to be honest, require more work than redoing from scratch with bootstrap for a superior result

## The navbar looks ugly.
Yes, but
 * It supports mobile
 * It is easily expandable
 * I can add a theme to make it better easily

## Why are there more pages on the navbar?
 * Home is the home page (`/`)
 * Logout is for the user account system I set up (`/logout`)
 * Tour is for the School View ('/tour')
 * Map is for the School Map linking to the School View (`/map`)
 * Articles is to access the articles (`/articles/[article number]`, `/articles`)
 * Forum is for the forum I want to add (`/forum`)
THIS ALL WORKS ON MOBILE (EXCEPT PANNELLUM)

## Accounts? Forums? Comments?
These have three purposes:
 * To flex our database to earn more marks
 * To become a social media service, as every website must eventually become
 * To collect emails

## Bootstrap?
It's a css library, like material, except more popular.

## What can I do on the project?
 * Continue updating streetview.js.
 * Make the map feature.
 * Follow the guide below on how to write articles.

### How to write articles
1. Follow the *How can I view this website* above.
2. There should be two `div`s - one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE TITLE HERE!` inside and one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE CONTENT HERE!`.
3. Put the title inside the first div, and the content inside the second. IMPORTANT - DON'T EDIT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THOSE DIVS!
4. Send me the html that you put inside, as well as the title

## If you need anything else, send me an email. I'll check my email. Probably.

# Q/A - For Stanley - Read not below
## Note that:
I'm keeping this for archival purposes. Stanley and I have resolved over this matter, and have found common ground. 

## What's this?
I know what this is idiot and I hate it. What is this Q/A for? To explain why I am angry. Because I am fuming, I will present this as a stuctured case - debating vibes.

## Points
### 1. This will take too much time and effort
### 2. This won't bring much more than we already have
### 3. You're making approx 5000 min (Class time + homework time + robot club) of past work amount to nothing.

## Rebuttal - My response to your points
### Why did you rewrite our school website?
Because it is less effort for a superior result

**Reply:** Baseless for starters, no reasoning. Superior result? Looks bad. Less effort? Bit late now + having to do major revamping of info page + back-end monstrosity of accounts and forum and comments + rewriting most of the website

### But where did my css go?
In no particular order:
 * The information page was unwieldy and not designed well for ruby
 * The landing page was preventing people from getting to the content of our webpage immediately, however this could be brought back
 * The navbar was unwieldy from a backend perspective, and not suited to navigating between multiple urls (something we are now doing)
 * The navbar also took up too much room, especially on mobile
 * The animations for switching pages do not support multiple urls (once again, something we are now doing)
 * Keeping the css would, to be honest, require more work than redoing from scratch with bootstrap for a superior result


**Reply:** In no particular order:
* Sure, but this means we are deleting a term's work + priortising a framework that Mr. Harrison will give up downloading + have to create an entirely new info page (will take more than time that we have)
* Look, I thought you wanted the starting page
* Sure, was unwieldy, but I quote you saying that mobile support dosen't matter + again quote you saying we don't really care about url access + will take work cssing it back up
* Sure, see last point
* Yes, see 2 points ago, also we could fix that easily, read JS, and you will understand, just have to update move() function
* Sure, bootstrap is cool but it is too late to change

### The navbar looks ugly.
Yes, but
 * It supports mobile
 * It is easily expandable
 * I can add a theme to make it better easily


**Reply:** Yes, but
* So what
* So what
* No. we have too much to do, and will also lose points on looks


### Why are there more pages on the navbar?
 * Home is the home page (`/`)
 * Logout is for the user account system I set up (`/logout`)
 * Tour is for the School View ('/tour')
 * Map is for the School Map linking to the School View (`/map`)
 * Articles is to access the articles (`/articles/[article number]`, `/articles`)
 * Forum is for the forum I want to add (`/forum`)
THIS ALL WORKS ON MOBILE (EXCEPT PANNELLUM)

**Reply:** We don't need this, as I will show in my next rebuttal point. We also shouldn't care about mobile as I have shown earlier.


### Accounts? Forums? Comments?
These have three purposes:
 * To flex our database to earn more marks
 * To become a social media service, as every website must eventually become
 * To collect emails


**Reply:** This will take way too much time that we don't have and:
* All we're doing is removing website marks for looks and adding them for backend. We can also use a db anyway without all theis massive change
* Social media is inethical, and we don't need it, you have said this before making you a hypocrite that has worse values than Mark Zuckerburg and Tim Cook combined. Sorry, but it seems so: at least they weren't hypocrites.
* Just no.

### Bootstrap?
It's a css library, like material, except more popular.

**Reply:** I know what it is, and its not worth it: it would be **IF WE HAD TIME**

### What can I do on the project?
 * Continue updating streetview.js.
 * Make the map feature.
 * Follow the guide below on how to write articles.


**Reply:** I don't really want to work on this project anymore.

### How to write articles
1. Follow the *How can I view this website* above.
2. There should be two `div`s - one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE TITLE HERE!` inside and one with `FRANKLIN, PUT THE CONTENT HERE!`.
3. Put the title inside the first div, and the content inside the second. IMPORTANT - DON'T EDIT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THOSE DIVS!
4. Send me the html that you put inside, as well as the title


**Reply:** See last reply.

## Conclusion
I am going to make my repository what I am developing on, not this. The only condition that would break this is if we were to come to agree on a common ground. This is unlikekly, and I would like to see what happens with you on your own. Bye.

# Common ground
See previous conclusion and note in previous section. Reading those sections will help you realise what common ground means. 

## Submission
We will be submitting 2 websites - the old one which had no proper back-end and wasn't really great (which we spent lots of work on), and the new one which has proper back-end and is cool (which is probably worth more marks). We are still working out how Mr. Harrison is going to view the website, but it seems to be using GitHub Student to unlock cloud hosting. 

## Workload allocation
Kashyap's work has not changed. Franklin is now tasked with entering data - for the panorama, and for the articles. He also needs to work on the branding for the website: show how much work Stanley put in for the back end among other things. If he has time then he will work on styling the website so that it looks cool. Stanley will be awesome and use Ruby on Rails to do cool stuff which is afore mentioned, and if he has time will join Franklin in his tasks.
